                        <p>Mental health services such as therapists can be extremely inaccessible for this demographic, these individuals express 
                            difficulties in finding help from professionals who can communicate in their native language, can understand the distinctive
                            issues they face (culture shock, racial identity, homesickness, etc), and are taking on new patients.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I conducted in-depth remote interviews with 30 newly immigrated Canadian immigrants (aged 18 - 60) to gain a better understanding of this demographic to help address their needs and 
                        build a meaningful solution.

                    <br><br>
                    <p>Interviews also showed that interviewees are hesitant towards seeking mental health treatment such as therapists due to 2 main constraints:</p>
                    <p>1. Difficulty finding a compatible therapist, even after trying out several practices</p>
                    <p>2. Lack of resources that help with finding therapists</p>

                    <p>This was ruled out because Chatbots are missing a human aspect and fail to create an intimate bond with the users,

                    <p> I wanted users to feel a sense of community while being on the app, I didn't want it to strictly feel like an "in and out" situation where they find a therapist, book an appointment, then leave.</p>
                    <p> In order to achieve this, I decided to implement a community Q&A section where users are able to freely (and anonymously) post questions that are on their mind and have those questions answered by therapists on the app.
                        Users are then able to read through the questions posted by other users and view the answers suggested by the therapists.</p>

                    <p>A usability study was conducted to observe how potential users would interact with the application. This helps identify what features of the application
                        are successful in completing its role and what features need futher improvement.</p>

                    <h6>Post-Usability Study Refinement</h6>
                    <p>After conducting a usability study, I was able to identify the features that users struggled with, I then set out to 
                        refine these features so that users can feel more comfortable with the experience.

                    <p>Users reported that the original filtering feature was not specific enough to narrow down a suitable therapist, so I made some changes to make 
                        the filtering process more tailored.</p>

                        was tucked away in the settings page, in the refined design, this feature was brought out into the side menu.

                    <p>Each user is unique in their lifestyles and the troubles they face, the advanced filtering option allows individuals to 
                        hone in on a specific area of help or a specific therapist that is very qualified and equipped to help them with the struggles they face.

                    <p>Design isn't a linear process - I want to conduct more usability studies with a wider range of participants to refine the design and 
                        provide a seamless digital solution.</p>
                    <p>Additional features - I am currently working on a payment process within the app, allowing users to both book and pay for their 
                        appointment on the app through different forms of payment (Visa, PayPal, etc) or health insurance.</p>
