                    <br>
                    <p>As many establishments began operating at a reduced capacity due to COVID-19, I started to see more and more lines pop-up outside of buildings throughout Ontario. 
                        <br><br>My decision to design a remote queuing system was born from my own frustrations as somebody who always finds herself standing in a line. With everything being integrated with technology these days, why hasn’t the mundane task of waiting in line made that bridge?  
                        <br><br>In this case study, I explore the accessibility concerns that come with the traditional queuing system and how we might digitize this task to make it an inclusive experience.</p>

                        Standing in one spot for a long period of time is an activity that not everyone’s bodies can perform.
                        <br>
                        Standing alone in an unfamiliar area is an activity that not everybody is comfortable with.
                        <br>
                        Standing outside in the cold is an activity that favours people who can afford a warm jacket.

                    <p>LineUp is for any Ontarian who experiences discomfort with the traditional physical queuing experience.
                        <br>These may be permanent, temporary, or situational discomforts that are faced.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>To get a better understanding of how I can design this app, I conducted <span><b>20 in-depth interviews with potential users in Ontario</b></span> to analyze their
                         thoughts on the traditional physical queuing experience. The interviewees were drawn at random and aged 18 to 67 living in Ontario, with occupations such as: 
                         students, front-line workers, essential workers, office workers, job-seekers, and retirees.</p>

                    <p>After reviewing the interview answers and conducting additional secondary research, I concluded 3 major flaws around the current physical queuing experience

                    <p>1. Customer mode - The mode intended for the user waiting in the queue to use (browsing queues, reviewing queues, joining queues)</p>
                    <p>2. Establishment mode - The mode intended for the user managing the establishment to use (adding users, admitting users, managing queues)</p>

                    <p>A possible way to resolve this issue is to have a manual insert feature on the manager’s dashboard, this way, people who do not own smartphones can be manually inserted into the system, given a wait time estimate, then wait in an area of their choosing.</p>
                    <p>The manual insert feature will also come in handy for those who own a smartphone but are not able to access it at the time of queuing (forgot it at home, battery died, poor connection, etc).</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Working on this project really opened my eyes to in the inequalities people experience with everyday tasks and how 
                        technology can be used to alleviate some of the discomforts people face. Something I had noticed while working on 
                        this project was that we need to be careful when designing digital solutions, we need to be careful to not exclude 
                        certain groups of people who do not have access to technology. This helped me understand that when creating a digital 
                        solution for an offline experience, it's always important to consider those who might be excluded from the "solution" 
                        and how we can avoid situations like these.</p>
